# diffable

## Diffable

A differential geometry framework for Rust. Each trait represents a
mathematical structure—group, vector space, smooth atlas, metric, and
so on. Implementing a trait certifies that a type carries that structure,
while blanket implementations derive the structures that follow from it.
In practice, implementing a single high-level trait often gives
you the surrounding geometry for free.

#### Structure

The library is organised around a hierarchy of traits that mirror the
mathematical structure of differential geometry.

##### Foundation — points, scalars, separation

- [`traits::Point`] — The underlying set: an element of a manifold, group, or
  metric space. Anything can be a Point, in fact; anything that is `Clone` is
  a `Point`.
- [`traits::Field`] — The scalar field of a vector space. Follows the field axioms.
- [`traits::Real`] — An ordered real-number field, used as a
  coordinate scalar and as the target of intervals and metrics. See
  [`traits::ExactCmp`] for the strict order that convergence tests need
  when an implementor's equality is tolerance-based.
- [`traits::Interval`] — A *signed* squared interval `s²: M × M → R`
  (negative timelike, zero null, positive spacelike); the pseudo-metric
  base, claiming no metric-space axioms. `interval_squared` is the
  primitive, `interval` its signed square root, returning `Complex<R: Real>`
- [`traits::Metric`] — the *definite* refinement: a genuine non-negative
  distance `d = √(interval_squared)`. Independent of any coordinate
  structure

##### Vector spaces and forms

- [`traits::Vector`] — A finite-dimensional coordinate vector space over a
  `Field`. It is the local model a [`traits::Chart`] maps into and the
  tangent space of every manifold, and is its own additive
  [`traits::LieGroup`]. [`traits::Dual`] is the dual space `V*`.
- A bare `Vector` carries no metric. Scalar products are induced by
  progressively stronger traits:
    - [`traits::Form`] gives a lowering map `♭: V → V*`
      and the induced pairing `dot`.
    - [`traits::Nondegenerate`] makes `♭` invertible by adding `♯`.
    - [`traits::Sesquilinear`] specialises to Hermitian forms.
    - [`traits::Bilinear`] specialises further to symmetric bilinear forms.
    - [`traits::InnerProduct`] adds positive definiteness.
- [`traits::Euclidean`] — The canonical flat `Rⁿ` that is simultaneously an
  inner-product space, its own tangent bundle, and an additive Lie group.

##### Charts — local coordinate structure

- [`traits::Chart`] — A coordinate chart mapping points of a manifold to a
  flat coordinate space and back.
- [`traits::ExpMap`] — A chart whose coordinate lines are geodesics and
  whose coordinate distances are (signed) arc lengths.
- [`traits::TangentBundle`] — The tangent bundle `TM`: an `ExpMap` chart
  centred at *every* point. This is the working surface of a smooth
  manifold — `exp` and `log`, geodesics, geodesic distance, and sectional
  curvature are all read off it, so most geometric computation is written
  against this trait.
- [`traits::PseudoRiemannian`] — Certifies that the exponential map and the
  tangent-space form agree: the geodesic interval equals `⟨v,v⟩`.
  Signature-agnostic; reduces to the usual `d(p, exp_p v) = ‖v‖` in the
  definite case.
- [`traits::Smooth`] — A helper trait for manifolds that charts themselves,
  providing `exp` and `log` at every point. Implement this one trait and the
  full chart bundle `Chart`, `ExpMap`, `TangentBundle` for free.

##### Algebra — groups and Lie groups

- [`traits::Group`] — an operator-agnostic group interface, using named
  methods rather than `+` or `*`.

  [`traits::CMonoid`]/[`traits::CGroup`] and
  [`traits::Monoid`]/[`traits::MulGroup`] are the additive and multiplicative
  presentations used by concrete types. The helper macros `impl_group_via_add!`
  and `impl_group_via_mul!` connect them to `Group`.

  [`traits::Rig`], [`traits::Ring`], [`traits::DivRing`],
  and [`traits::Field`] combine both operations.
- [`traits::LieGroup`] — a group with a smooth exponential map at the
  identity; automatically derives `Smooth` (and therefore the whole chart
  bundle) via left translation
- [`traits::Quotient`] — a quotient `G/H` of a Lie group by a subgroup,
  inheriting Lie group structure from the parent

##### Global topology — covers, nerve complexes, fundamental groups and global geodesic minimisation

- [`traits::Bounded`] — a `TangentBundle` chart with a bounded, open domain,
  expressed via a signed distance field.
- [`traits::NerveComplex`] — a finite cover of a manifold by `Bounded`
  charts whose overlap pattern forms a simplicial complex; computes global
  geodesic distance by graph search and recovers the fundamental group
  `π₁(M)` from the nerve. Since the cover finite and open,
  NerveComplex serves as a proof that the implemented manifold is compact.
- [`traits::GroupPresentation`] — a group described by generators and
  relations; the output of `NerveComplex::fundamental_group`. Group presentation
  does not implement `Group` because the
  [word problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_(mathematics))
  is uncomputable in general.

##### Blanket chains

Implement one trait; receive the these for free:

| Trait                               | Blaket impls                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `Smooth<V>`                         | `Chart`, `ExpMap`, `TangentBundle` |
| `LieGroup<V>`                       | `Smooth<V>` → ...                  |
| `Vector`                            | `Group`, `LieGroup<Self>` → ...    |
| `Quotient<G, H, V>` (via macro)     | `Group`, `LieGroup<V>` → ...       |
| `Sesquilinear<F: Field<Fixed = F>>` | `Bilinear`                         |


`Group` itself is reached via a one-line macro rather than a blanket impl
(`CMonoid`/`Monoid` can't both blanket-impl the same trait without
overlapping), so every `LieGroup` implementor pairs its `+`/`*` structure
with `impl_group_via_add!`/`impl_group_via_mul!` before joining the chain.

#### Implementations

- [`coords::Coords`] — the canonical flat space `R^(N−M, M)`, a fixed-size
  array parameterised by a signature `M` (the count of timelike
  directions). `M = 0` is ordinary Euclidean `Rⁿ` (with a norm and metric);
  `M > 0` is indefinite (`Coords<R, 4, 1>` is Minkowski spacetime),
  carrying only a `Bilinear` form
- [`complex::Complex`] — the complex numbers as a `Field`, with `conj` the
  Hermitian involution. [`traits::Symmetrized`] wraps a field to select its
  *bilinear* rather than Hermitian form
- [`matrix::Matrix`] — an `N×N` matrix, interpreted as the tensor
  `V ⊗ V*`, with variance encoded in the type so only variance-correct
  contractions typecheck. [`matrix::MatrixExponential`] provides `exp`/`log`.
- [`hypersphere::Sphere`] — the unit hypersphere `Sⁿ` as a smooth manifold
  with geodesic structure for any dimension
- [`hypersphere::S0`], [`hypersphere::UnitComplex`], [`hypersphere::S3`] —
  the Lie group structures on the three parallelizable spheres (signs, the
  unit complex numbers `U(1)`, the unit quaternions `SU(2)`), as newtypes
  of `Sphere` that add the group operation
- [`hypersphere::So3`] — the rotation group `SO(3)` as the quotient
  `S³/{±1}`, a newtype of `S3`
- [`hypersphere::Stereographic`] — stereographic projection charts, an
  external atlas independent of the geodesic self-charts
- [`spacetime::Minkowski`] — `Coords<R, 4, 1>`, spacetime with signature
  `(−,+,+,+)`; [`spacetime::Sl`]/[`spacetime::Sl2c`] the special linear
  group (`SL(2,ℂ)` double-covering the Lorentz group);
  [`spacetime::SlAlgebra`] its traceless Lie algebra with the Killing form;
  and [`spacetime::Lorentz`] the restricted Lorentz group `SO⁺(1,3)` as
  `SL(2,ℂ)/{±1}`
- [`discrete::Z`] — the integers, as the Grothendieck completion of the
  naturals [`discrete::N`]; also the covering lattice for `flat::S1`
- [`flat::S1`] — the circle as the flat quotient `R/Z`, a more performant
  model of `S¹` than `hypersphere::UnitComplex`;
  [`flat::Torus`]/[`flat::KleinBottle`] glue two circles straight (a group)
  or with a fibre-flipping twist (the library's only non-orientable
  manifold)

The newtype layering reflects the mathematical structure: `Sphere` is the
bare manifold (geometry only), `S3` adds the quaternion group operation,
and `So3` adds the antipodal identification. Each wrapper is zero-cost and
peelable — `.0` is the forgetful functor dropping one layer of structure.

#### Testing

Diffable takes the philosophy that any axiom which is assumed true of a type
but not directly enforcable by the compiler should be emperically verified
via property testing. Enable the `testing` feature to access the `test_*`
macros, which verify that your implementations satisfy the mathematical
invariants certified by each trait. The `Real` types `R64` and `R32` provide
tolerance-based equality suitable for property testing with floating point,
since the library assumes that its real numbers are perfect.

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
diffable = { version = "...", features = ["testing"] }
```

#### Optional features

- `testing` — property-testing macros and tolerance-based scalar types
- `all` — enables all features
