//! # Diffable
//!
//! A differential geometry framework for Rust. Implementing a trait certifies
//! that a type carries the corresponding mathematical structure — a group
//! operation, a metric, a smooth atlas — and the trait hierarchy encodes the
//! dependency order between those structures, so blanket implementations
//! derive the consequences automatically.
//!
//! ## Structure
//!
//! The library is organised around a hierarchy of traits that mirror
//! the mathematical structure of differential geometry:
//!
//! ### Foundation — sets, intervals, scalar products
//!
//! These come in matched **definite / indefinite** pairs: the indefinite
//! member is the base, and the definite member refines it by adding
//! positive-definiteness (and the metric-space structure that definiteness
//! makes available).
//!
//! - [`traits::Point`] — an element of a carrier set; no topology, no
//!   smoothness, just the ability to hold and duplicate a value
//! - [`traits::Scalar`] — a real-number type for use as a coordinate field;
//!   see its doc comment for the library's stance on approximate equality
//! - [`traits::Interval`] — a *signed* squared interval `s²: M × M → R`
//!   (negative timelike, zero null, positive spacelike); the pseudo-metric
//!   base, claiming no metric-space axioms
//! - [`traits::Metric`] — a distance function `d: M × M → R` satisfying the
//!   metric-space axioms; the definite refinement, bridged into `Interval`
//!   by `s² = d²`. Independent of any coordinate structure
//! - [`traits::Bilinear`] — a symmetric bilinear scalar product `⟨·,·⟩` of
//!   *arbitrary signature*, with a signed `norm_squared` but **no** norm or
//!   distance; the Minkowski-capable base
//! - [`traits::InnerProduct`] — a *positive-definite* `Bilinear` form,
//!   inducing a genuine norm and (via `Metric`) a distance; the definite
//!   refinement
//!
//! ### Charts — local coordinate structure
//!
//! - [`traits::Chart`] — a coordinate chart mapping points of a manifold to
//!   a flat (pseudo-)Euclidean coordinate space and back
//! - [`traits::ExpMap`] — a chart whose coordinate lines are geodesics and
//!   whose coordinate distances are (signed) arc lengths
//! - [`traits::TangentBundle`] — a family of `ExpMap` charts, one centred
//!   at each point of the manifold; the tangent bundle `TM`
//! - [`traits::PseudoRiemannian`] — certifies that the exponential map and
//!   the tangent-space scalar product agree: the geodesic interval equals
//!   `Q(v) = ⟨v,v⟩`. Signature-agnostic; reduces to the usual Riemannian
//!   `d(p, exp_p v) = ‖v‖` in the definite case
//!
//! ### Smooth structure — self-charting manifolds
//!
//! - [`traits::Smooth`] — a manifold that charts itself: provides `exp` and
//!   `log` at every point, automatically generating `Chart`, `ExpMap`, and
//!   `TangentBundle` via blanket implementations; the only trait a
//!   self-charting manifold needs to implement
//!
//! ### Algebra — groups and Lie groups
//!
//! - [`traits::Group`] — an associative composition with identity and
//!   inverses, spelled with operator-agnostic named methods (`compose`,
//!   `inverse`) rather than `Add`/`Mul`, so it covers abelian and
//!   non-abelian groups alike; purely algebraic, no smoothness required.
//!   [`traits::CMonoid`]/[`traits::CGroup`] (`+`, commutative) and
//!   [`traits::Monoid`]/[`traits::MulGroup`] (`*`, not assumed commutative)
//!   are the two operator-flavoured presentations a concrete type may use,
//!   bridged to `Group` in one line via `impl_group_via_add!`/
//!   `impl_group_via_mul!`; [`traits::Rig`]/[`traits::Ring`] combine both
//!   for types with a compatible addition and multiplication
//! - [`traits::LieGroup`] — a group with a smooth exponential map at the
//!   identity; automatically derives `Smooth` (and therefore the full chart
//!   bundle) via left translation
//! - [`traits::Quotient`] — a quotient `G/H` of a Lie group by a subgroup,
//!   inheriting Lie group structure from the parent
//!
//! ### (Pseudo-)Euclidean — flat space
//!
//! - [`traits::Quadratic`] — flat coordinate space `Rⁿ` with a
//!   [`traits::Bilinear`] scalar product of arbitrary signature (Minkowski
//!   included); its own tangent bundle and an additive Lie group. The
//!   indefinite base, carrying no norm or distance
//! - [`traits::Euclidean`] — the positive-definite refinement: the canonical
//!   flat space `Rⁿ` that is simultaneously an inner-product space, its own
//!   tangent bundle, and an additive Lie group, with all three structures
//!   coinciding trivially
//!
//! ### Global topology — covers, nerves, fundamental groups
//!
//! - [`traits::Bounded`] — a `TangentBundle` chart with a bounded domain,
//!   expressed via a signed distance field
//! - [`traits::NerveComplex`] — a finite cover of a manifold by `Bounded`
//!   charts, whose overlap pattern forms a simplicial complex; computes
//!   global geodesic distance by graph search and recovers the fundamental
//!   group `π₁(M)` from the nerve
//! - [`traits::GroupPresentation`] — a group described by generators and
//!   relations; the output type of `NerveComplex::fundamental_group`
//!
//! ### Blanket chains
//!
//! The following chains fire automatically — implement the left-hand trait,
//! receive the right-hand traits for free:
//!
//! ```text
//! Smooth<V>             →  Chart<Self, V>, ExpMap<Self, V>, TangentBundle<Self, V>
//! LieGroup<V>           →  Smooth<V>  →  Chart, ExpMap, TangentBundle
//! Quadratic/Euclidean   →  Group, LieGroup<Self>  →  Smooth<Self>  →  Chart, ExpMap, TangentBundle
//! Quotient<G, H, V>     (via macro)  →  Group, LieGroup<V>  →  Smooth  →  ...
//! ```
//!
//! `Group` itself is reached via a one-line macro rather than a blanket
//! impl (`CMonoid`/`Monoid` can't both blanket-impl the same trait without
//! overlapping), so every `LieGroup` implementor pairs its `+`/`*`
//! structure with `impl_group_via_add!`/`impl_group_via_mul!` before
//! joining the chain above.
//!
//! ## Implementations
//!
//! - [`coords::Coords`] — the canonical flat (pseudo-)Euclidean space
//!   `R^(N−M, M)`, a fixed-size array of scalars parameterised by a signature
//!   `M` (the count of negative/timelike directions). The default `M = 0` is
//!   ordinary Euclidean `Rⁿ` (with a norm and metric); `M > 0` is indefinite
//!   (`Coords<R, 4, 1>` is Minkowski spacetime), carrying only a `Bilinear`
//!   scalar product
//! - [`hypersphere::Sphere`] — the unit hypersphere `Sⁿ` as a smooth
//!   manifold with geodesic structure for any dimension
//! - [`hypersphere::S0`], [`hypersphere::UnitComplex`],
//!   [`hypersphere::S3`] — the Lie group structures on `S⁰` (signs under
//!   multiplication), `S¹` (unit complex numbers), and `S³` (unit
//!   quaternions), as newtypes of `Sphere` that add group operations
//! - [`hypersphere::So3`] — the rotation group `SO(3)` as the quotient
//!   `S³/{±1}`, a newtype of `S3`
//! - [`hypersphere::Stereographic`] — stereographic projection charts for
//!   spheres, an external atlas independent of the geodesic self-charts
//! - [`discrete::Z`] — the integers, as the Grothendieck completion of the
//!   naturals [`discrete::N`]; also a degenerate 0-dimensional `LieGroup`
//! - [`flat::S1`] — the circle as the flat quotient `R/Z`; a more
//!   performant alternative model of `S¹` to `hypersphere::UnitComplex`
//! - [`flat::Torus`], [`flat::KleinBottle`] — flat surfaces built from two
//!   `flat::S1` coordinates, glued straight (a group) or with a
//!   fibre-flipping twist (not a group; the library's only non-orientable
//!   manifold)
//!
//! The newtype layering reflects the mathematical structure: `Sphere` is the
//! bare manifold (geometry only), `S3` adds the quaternion group operation,
//! and `So3` adds the antipodal identification. Each wrapper is zero-cost
//! and peelable — `.0` is the forgetful functor dropping one layer of
//! algebraic structure.
//!
//! ## Testing
//!
//! Enable the `testing` feature to access the `test_*` macros, which verify
//! that your implementations satisfy the mathematical invariants certified
//! by each trait. The scalar types [`R64`] and [`R32`] provide
//! tolerance-based equality suitable for property testing with floating
//! point.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dev-dependencies]
//! diffable = { version = "...", features = ["testing"] }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Optional features
//!
//! - `testing` — property-testing macros and tolerance-based scalar types
//! - `all` — enables all features
