/// A finite-dimensional Euclidean space.
///
/// The space of all values of a type `E: Euclidean` is interpreted as
/// `R^N` (with `R := E::F` and `N := E::N`) — the canonical flat, *positive-
/// definite* space of dimension `N` over the field `R`. This is the space in
/// which local coordinate charts take their values, and in which tangent
/// vectors live.
///
/// `Euclidean` is the **definite real-valued refinement** of [`Quadratic`]:
/// it is a pseudo-Euclidean space (signature `(N, 0)`) that additionally
/// carries an [`InnerProduct`] — a positive-definite pairing inducing a genuine
/// `norm` and a [`Metric`]. Where the pseudo-Euclidean base has only a signed
/// [`Bilinear`] scalar product, a Euclidean space has all the metric-space
/// structure on top, because definiteness is exactly what makes
/// `sqrt(⟨v,v⟩)` real and the induced distance a metric.
///
/// Beyond the algebraic structure of a vector space (`Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`,
/// `Neg`, `Zero`), it carries that inner product and a canonical tangent
/// bundle ([`TangentBundle`]) whose charts are globally defined with infinite
/// injectivity radius — reflecting the flatness of the space.
///
/// # Flatness
/// Unlike a general Riemannian manifold, a Euclidean space is flat: geodesics
/// are straight lines, parallel transport is path-independent, and the
/// exponential map is a global isomorphism rather than merely a local one.
/// These properties are verified by the `check_*` methods inherited from
/// [`TangentBundle`] and [`Quadratic`] (`check_global_chart`,
/// `check_global_geodesic_scaling`, `check_translation_invariance`), together
/// with the definite-only `check_pythagorean` below.
///
/// # Implementing
/// Use the `test_euclidean!` macro to verify that your implementation
/// satisfies the Euclidean axioms. (For an indefinite space, implement only
/// [`Quadratic`] and use `test_pseudo_euclidean!` instead.)

/// can be positive, negative, or zero. Minkowski spacetime is the archetype.
///
/// This is the **indefinite base**; [`Euclidean`] is its positive-definite
/// refinement. Because the form is only [`Bilinear`], a pseudo-Euclidean
/// space has **no norm and no [`Metric`]** — `sqrt(⟨v,v⟩)` need not be real,
/// null vectors give distinct points at zero separation, and the triangle
/// inequality reverses on timelike triples. Operations that need a genuine
/// norm or distance (e.g. `check_pythagorean`, `local_distance`,
